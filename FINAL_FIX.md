# ✅ Final Fix Applied!

## Issue Resolved
The error `Field "created_at" cannot accept the provided value` indicated that the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields are auto-generated by Airtable and shouldn't be set manually.

## ✅ What I Fixed:
1. **Removed timestamp fields** from all create/update operations
2. **Let Airtable auto-generate** `created_at` and `updated_at` fields
3. **Kept the field names** exactly as they appear in your schema
4. **Maintained proper date/time handling** for the `date` field

## 🎯 Current Configuration:
- **Field names**: Exact match to your Airtable schema (lowercase with underscores)
- **Date handling**: Combines date + time into ISO datetime string for the `date` field
- **Timestamps**: Auto-generated by Airtable (not manually set)

## 🚀 Ready to Test:
**Try creating an event now!** The service should work perfectly with your Airtable schema.

The error progression shows we're on the right track:
1. ❌ "Unknown field name: 'time'" → Fixed field names
2. ❌ "Unknown field name: 'Title'" → Fixed capitalization  
3. ❌ "Field 'created_at' cannot accept the provided value" → Fixed auto-generated fields
4. ✅ **Should work now!**

## Debug Available:
If you want to test the connection:
```javascript
await window.airtableDebug.debugConnection()
await window.airtableDebug.testSchema()
```

But it should work perfectly now! 🎉
