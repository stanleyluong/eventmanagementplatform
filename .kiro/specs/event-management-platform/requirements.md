# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a web-based event management platform that allows users to create, share, and RSVP to events. The platform will be deployed using AWS Amplify for hosting and CI/CD, with Airtable serving as the backend database for storing event data and user responses. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for event organizers to manage their events and for attendees to discover and respond to invitations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to create new events with detailed information, so that I can share them with potential attendees.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the event creation form THEN the system SHALL display fields for event title, description, date, time, location, and capacity
2. WHEN a user submits a complete event form THEN the system SHALL save the event to Airtable and generate a unique event ID
3. WHEN an event is successfully created THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with a shareable event link
4. IF any required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent form submission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an event organizer, I want to view and manage my created events, so that I can track attendance and make updates as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event organizer logs in THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with all their created events
2. WHEN viewing an event details page THEN the system SHALL show current RSVP count and attendee list
3. WHEN an organizer clicks edit on their event THEN the system SHALL allow modification of event details
4. WHEN an organizer updates event information THEN the system SHALL save changes to Airtable and notify existing RSVPs of updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a potential attendee, I want to view event details and RSVP, so that I can participate in events that interest me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits an event link THEN the system SHALL display complete event information including title, description, date, time, location, and available spots
2. WHEN a user clicks RSVP THEN the system SHALL prompt for their name and email address
3. WHEN a user submits their RSVP THEN the system SHALL save their response to Airtable and send a confirmation
4. IF an event is at capacity THEN the system SHALL display "Event Full" and disable RSVP functionality
5. WHEN a user has already RSVP'd THEN the system SHALL show their current status and allow them to cancel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an event attendee, I want to receive confirmation and updates about events I've RSVP'd to, so that I stay informed about event details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully RSVPs THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with event details
2. WHEN an event organizer updates event details THEN the system SHALL notify all RSVP'd attendees
3. WHEN a user cancels their RSVP THEN the system SHALL remove them from the attendee list and update available capacity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to be responsive and fast-loading, so that I can access it easily from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN the website loads on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a desktop-optimized layout
3. WHEN any page loads THEN the system SHALL complete initial render within 3 seconds
4. WHEN users interact with forms THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to integrate seamlessly with AWS Amplify and Airtable, so that deployment and data management are automated and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN AWS Amplify SHALL automatically build and deploy the website
2. WHEN the application makes API calls THEN the system SHALL successfully connect to Airtable using secure authentication
3. WHEN data is stored or retrieved THEN the system SHALL handle Airtable API rate limits gracefully
4. IF Airtable is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to users
