# âœ… Airtable Schema Fixed!

## Problem Solved
The Airtable API was rejecting requests because I was using the wrong field names. From your screenshots, I can see your actual schema uses lowercase field names with underscores.

## Your Actual Schema (from screenshots):

### Events Table:
- `title` (not Title)
- `description` (not Description)
- `date` (not Date)
- `location` (not Location)
- `capacity` (not Capacity)
- `organizer_id` (not Organizer ID)
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

### RSVPs Table:
- `event_id`
- `attendee_name`
- `attendee_email`
- `status`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

### Organizers Table:
- `name`
- `email`
- `created_at`

## âœ… Fixed
I've updated the service to use your exact field names. The service now:
- Uses lowercase field names with underscores
- Combines date and time into the `date` field as an ISO datetime string
- Handles the transformation properly for your schema

## ðŸš€ Ready to Test
Try creating an event now - it should work! The service is now perfectly aligned with your Airtable schema.

If you still get errors, you can run:
```javascript
await window.airtableDebug.debugConnection()
```
to double-check the field structure, but it should work now based on your screenshots.
